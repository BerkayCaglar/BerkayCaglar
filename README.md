### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Berkay Ã‡aÄŸlar
#### Junior Programmer

A large part of my life has been spent with computers and I have improved myself with programs, research and projects since I was a child.
I continued to strive to specialize further in this area.
I brought myself to a certain level in all aspects of the software and mastered the Syntax format of most languages.
The languages â€‹â€‹that I have developed myself in this regard are as follows; HTML, CSS, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, Python, C , C++, C#, MYSQL, MSSQL, Flutter, Dart and Unity.
I always continue to research and develop myself to be a sought-after software developer in this sector.

Skills: UNITY / C# / PYHTON / HTML / CSS / JS
